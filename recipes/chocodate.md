# Ingredients
- 3½ cups + 2 tablespoons unbleached all purpose flour
  - Comes out even better if you store flour in the freezer
- 1¼ teaspoons baking soda
- 1½ teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon kosher salt for dry mix, and a few pinches for topping
- ½ teaspoon "holiday" spices
  - Nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, pumpkin spice, etc.
- 1¼ cups softened butter (salted)
- 1¼ cups brown sugar (dark pref)
- 1 cup + 2 tablespoons sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1½ bags of Ghirardelli 60% cacao chocolate chips
- 1 cup finely chopped dates
  - **Yes**, chop whole dates. Wetting the knife occasionally will help.
  - Don't get the pre-chopped date poops from the grocery store.

Makes eighteen 5 inch perfect crunchy-on-the-outside, chewy-on-the-inside cookies without nuts!

# Preparation
1. If your flour is frozen, preheat oven to 375°F
2. Sift dry ingredients together into a bowl.
3. Cream butter and sugar in a stand mixer until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, vanilla, and spices then mix well.
4. Add dates, mix well, and let sit for a minute.
5. Add dry ingredients to wet slowly, mix just until combined, 5-10 seconds. Mix in chocolate chips last.
6. If the flour was cold, the dough should be fairly cool and you can go on to the next step.
   1. Otherwise, smooth dough and cover tightly with plastic wrap.
   2. Refrigerate 30 mins.
   3. Preheat oven to 375°F half way through refrigeration
7. Line baking sheet(s) with parchment paper
8. Scoop big golfball size mounds of dough and sprinkle lightly with sea salt
   - An ice cream scoop works well here.
9. Bake just until golden brown highlights appear, 15-16 minutes.
10. Let cookies cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes, then transfer to wire rack
11. Use two baking sheets, one in the oven and one cooling/being loaded with dough.
    - **NOTE**: **DO NOT** put dough on a hot baking sheet.
