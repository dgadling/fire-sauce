# Ingredients
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 pound spicy Italian sausage (see note in prep)
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2¼ cups low-sodium chicken broth (or just 1 can)
- 1¾ cups water (or 2⅔ cups if using one can broth)
  - original recipe says 2¼ cups
- 8 ounces (2½ cups) penne
- ½ cup oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes, pre-cut if possible
- one 6 ounce bag baby spinach
- ½ cup grated Parmesan
- ¼ cup toasted pine nuts

# Method of Preparation
1. Heat oil in a 12” pan or dutch oven over medium-high until just smoking
2. Add sausage and cook until lightly browned, breaking up with spoon, about 3 minutes.
3. If using pork sausage, sop up extra oil with paper towel (or drain) before moving on. If using turkey/chicken sausage, don’t bother.
4. Stir in garlic and cook until fragrant, about 30 sec
5. Stir in water, broth, penne, and tomatoes.
6. Increase heat to high and cook, stirring often until penne is tender and liquid is mostly gone, 15 to 18 minutes.
  - I had to add extra water; maybe I had too much penne.
  - The original recipe says to add ½ teaspoon of salt; I found this made the final product a bit too salty.
7. Stir in entire bag of spinach, one handful at a time, and cook until wilted.
8. Take off heat, stir in Parmesan and pine nuts
9. Serve immediately! :tada::tada::tada:
