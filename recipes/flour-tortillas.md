This was originally transcribed from America's Test Kichen's [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Yu7KbrQ0Y0).
After that didn't work out I watched [Tia Mari](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdTW9yue948) make tortillas and adjusted accordingly.

# Ingredients
- 345 g all purpose flour
- 3 g salt (1%)
- 69 g lard (20%)
- 1 cup (236 mL) 70 °C (158 °F) water (68%)

This makes **about 12** "soft taco" sized tortillas.

# Directions
## Prep
1. Whisk the flour and salt together
2. Add the lard and cut in with your hand(s) until well mixed in
3. Add the hot water and mix until it _just_ comes together. You should still have some flour chunks that aren't incorporated
4. Knead until _just_ forms a smooth cohesive ball. This should take < 5 minutes.
5. Return to bowl, cover with film, and let sit for 10 minutes
6. Set aside a small container of flour
7. Squeeze out large golf balls for taco-sized tortillas and roll in your hands or on your table to smooth them out.
8. Press each one into the flour, squashing a bit to make them flat, then put on a plate.

At this point they can rest in the fridge for up to 3 days, apparently.

## Cooking
1. Roll into as-round-as-you-can tortillas, as thin as you can. Set them aside as made
2. Get your pan ripping hot then turn it down slightly
3. Cook tortillas for about 1 minute until small bubbles form, then flip and cook about 1 minute longer
4. Remove from heat and sandwich in towels to prevent drying
5. Repeat!

You can use these right away!
To save, stack with interleaved parchment paper, cover with plastic wrap, and store in fridge for up to 3 days.

Using [King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour](https://shop.kingarthurflour.com/items/king-arthur-unbleached-all-purpose-flour-5-lb) and [Armour Lard](https://www.armourlard.com/Products) and making 12 equally sized tortillas you end up at:

# Notes
- When forming the balls the dough should weld back together. If it doesn't, dip your finger tips in water then rework. Add more water next time.
- Butter flavored shortening is popular with Canadians
- Try not to roll flat in more than 4-5 passes. The fewer the better
