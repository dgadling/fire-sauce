## How To

The critical thing to get right here is the amount of liquid in the pot when the rice goes into cook.

1.  Brown pork and remove from pot*
2.  Brown sausage and remove from pot, drain most of the grease*
3.  Cook onions till caramelized
4.  Add the rest of the vegetables and cook till tender
5.  Add the meat and seasoning to the pot, add just enough water to the pot so you can stir.
    * **NOTE** this water is **not** from the 3 ½ cups in the ingredients list.
6.  Simmer for around 30 minutes stirring occasaionaly to prevent sticking.  Add water if necessary to keep things stirrable.
7.  Mix beef broth and water; then add to pot
8.  Bring pot to a boil 
9.  Add rice and cook till most of the water is gone.  About 10 to 12 minute, stirring continuously on medium high heat.  The spoon should be able to lay on top of the jambalaya  without sinking.
10. Reduce to very low heat and cover pot. **DO NOT** REMOVE cover for 15 minutes.
    * On my gas stove this is the lowest possible heat.
    * While cooking you should see small wisps of steam escaping the pot. Large amounts of steam means you have too much heat or a leaky lid. Small wisps indicates having enough heat to steam the rice.
    * If at the end of this your rice isn't steamed your lid was leaking. If it's dried out then your heat was too high.
11. After 15 minutes remove cover and stir jambalaya.  The bottom of the pot may burn so _carefully_ feel the bottom of the pot with the tip of spoon.  You do not want to stir the burned bits up.  If the jambalya is cooked proerly you'll have a small layer of crispy rice at the bottom.  It's ok to have some burnt bits on the bottom of the pot, if you have a burnt layer on the bottom of the pot try less heat next time.   

Notes:
* You will want a very dark brown on the pork and sausage.  It is ok, and even desirable, to have some meat sticking to the bottom of the pot.  Adding the onions should deglaze the bottom of the pot.
