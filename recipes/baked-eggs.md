# Note
This isn't a recipe, but a technique to "boil" a lot of eggs at once. It's especially useful if you're making egg salad or similar.

# Method
1. Put a baking sheet on the bottom of the oven.
2. Place all the eggs directly on the oven rack. They should fit nicely
   - The baking sheet will catch any broken eggs for easy cleanup.
3. Bake the eggs at 325Â°F for 30 minutes -- **do not preheat**
4. Prep a large bowl of very cold water with extra ice
5. Remove eggs from oven using tongs, putting them directly into the water bath
   - This will stop the eggs from cooking *and* make them easier to peel.
6. For each egg:
   1. Crack and remove the top & bottom shell
   2. Blow into the top and the egg will pop out the bottom
