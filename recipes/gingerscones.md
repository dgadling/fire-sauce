# Ginger Scones
From Nancy Silverton's Pastries from the La Brea Bakery

Makes 8 scones

## Ingredients
- 2¼ cups unbleached flour
- ⅓ cup granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1 tsp finely chopped lemon zest (1/2 lemon)
- 1½ sticks (6 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into 1-inch cubes and frozen
- 4½ ounces candied ginger, finely chopped into 1/4 inch pieces
- ¾ cup heavy cream, plust extra for brushing the tops of scones

## Preparation
1. Adjust the oven rack to the middle position and preheat to 400°F
2. In the bowl of a food processor with a steel blade or a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, combine flour, sugar, baking powder and pulse on low to mix
3. Add lemon zest and butter, pulse on and off to mix until mixture is pale yellow and the consistency of fine meal
4. Transfer mixture to a large bowl and stir in the ginger. Make a well in the center and pour in the cream. Fold in the dry ingredients and mix just until combined.
5. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Flour your hands and work the dough into a ball, then pat into a circle about 3/5 inches thick. Cut out 3" circles, then gather scraps and repeat with remaining dough.
6. Brush the tops with the remaining cream and bake for 12 to 16 minutes, until the surface cracks and they are lightly browned
