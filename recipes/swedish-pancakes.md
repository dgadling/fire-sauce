# Ingredients
- 2 eggs
- 1½ cup milk
- ¼ cup heavy whipping cream
- ⅓ cup sugar
- ¼ teaspoons vanilla extract (you can use a bit more if you want)
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1¼ cup **sifted** flour

Makes approximately nine 12" pancakes.

# Method of Preparation
1. Combine all above, order doesn't matter
2. Heat a 12" pan on medium-by-medium-low heat
3. Heat oven to 200°F (for keeping finished pancakes warm)
   - **NOTE**: I put plates in to store the pancakes on *and* warm plates. You may want to use a cookie sheet or nothing at all.
4. Make pancakes!
   1. Dispense batter ½ cup at a time, tilting pan to create desired size
   2. Flip once the bottom of the pancake has slightly browned, about 1 minute
   3. Give the other side about 1 minute to finish per side
   4. Put pancake in the oven to keep warm; it takes a while to make them all
