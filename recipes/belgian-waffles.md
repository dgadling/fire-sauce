# Ingredients
- 2½ cups sifted all-purpose flour
- 4 tablespoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons baking powder
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 3 eggs, separated
- 2 cups milk
- ½ cup vegetable oil

Makes 8 waffles using the [Cuisinart Rotary Belgian Waffle Maker](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-Rotary-Belgian-Waffle-Maker/dp/B0000VZZCM).

# Method of Preparation
1. Set oven to 200°F, optionally add serving plates.
2. Sift together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
3. In a large bowl, beat the egg yolks, add the milk and then add the sifted dry ingredients.
4. In a small bowl, beat the egg whites to a thick foam and fold them gently to the wet ingredients.
5. Cook your waffles on setting 3
   - Apply more cooking spray about every third waffle
   - @dgadling likes to wait a few extra seconds after the timer goes off before flipping and opening. This generally makes the waffle stick to the top of the iron, making it easier to get out.
6. Add your waffles to the oven to keep them warm
   - Putting them directly on the grate will help them stay crisp
   - Putting them directly on the plates will tend to soften them
