## Tips

* This is a meat pie, so use really good meat.
* You can replace the wine with broth, but that's lame.
* Pick a good cooking wine that can take some heat. Usually I try to find something with Grenache in it. Make sure you like to drink it because there will be a lot left.
* I find using my hands works best for bringing the dough together and judging whether or not to add more water.
* The dough should not feel dry and should be pressed into a ball fairly easily. But it should not feel sticky either.
The egg wash is what will give your tourtière a golden glow, so don't skip this step!
* get cute cookie cutters to make your crust look cute.
* You can vary the consistency of the filling by changing the preparation of the potatoes.
 * Roasted  and coarsely mashed is my preference.
 * Plain mash will act as a binding agent.
 * Chunky / cubed boiled potatoes work too.

## Method of Preparation

### Filling
1. In a large skillet or wok, over medium heat combine the finely chopped onion with the olive oil and sauté until onions are soft and golden (about 10 minutes)
1. With your hands, mix the ground pork and beef together in a bowl.
1. Add the mixed ground meat to the onions and cook for about 10 minutes, stirring it to break up the meat so it doesn't clump together.
1. Add all the remaining ingredients (broth, spices, mashed potato, salt and pepper) and mix together.
1. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for about 20 to 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until most of the liquid is absorbed.
1. Remove from heat.
1. Taste the meat mixture and add a bit more salt, pepper, or spices, to suit your preferences.
1. Cool in the fridge for about 2 hours, until completely chilled.

### Pastry

1. cut the butter into small cubes and chill them so they are very cold.
1. Using a food processor or a pastry blender, chop up the butter into the flour and salt until it is small and crumbly, the size of very small peas.
1. Pour in ½ cup of the ice cold water and mix into the flour.
1. Add more water, 1 tablespoonful at a time, until the dough comes together into a ball.
1. Form two balls and flatten them slightly into discs.
1. Wrap and cover them in wax paper or plastic, and let them rest in the fridge for 1 hour.

### Assembly

1. Preheat oven to 375°F
1. Remove from the fridge and allow to sit at room temperature for 5 minutes.
1. Roll out each disc on a floured surface to about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness.
1. Line pie plate(s) from the first circle of dough.
1. Spoon in all the meat filling, patting it down lightly to compress it a bit.
1. Brush the pie rim with water and place dough from the second circle on top, pressing the edges together to seal.
1. Trim and flute as desired.
1. Beat the egg and water together and brush the mixture all over the top of the crust and around the edges.
1. Cut some steam vents on top of your pie.
1. In the bottom third of the oven, bake for 50 minutes, or until the top of the crust in golden.
