Beverly''s Lemon Cake

# Ingredients
- 4 eggs
- 1 (15.25-ounce) box yellow or butter cake mix
- 1 (3.4-ounce) package instant lemon jello mix
- 1 t vanilla
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup vegetable oil
- 1/3 cup lemon juice (fresh)
- 2 cups sifted powdered sugar

# Directions

1. Heat oven to 350 F. Use cooking spray to grease an 13 x 9 sheet pan.
2. In a mixing bowl, beat eggs until thick and pale yellow.
3. Add the cake mix, dry jello mix, water, and vegetable oil. Using an electric mixer, beat at medium speed for 10 minutes.
4. Pour batter into greased pan.
5. Bake the cake for about 50 minutes, or until a wooden pick or cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. Place the pan on a wire rack and let the cake cool for about 15 minutes.
6. In a saucepan, combine the lemon juice and sifted powdered sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Once the sugar is dissolved you can stop boiling.
7. Use a fork to prick several holes in the top of the cake.
8. Drizzle the hot glaze over the top and spread over the sides of the cake. Serve and enjoy!

## Notes from Mom:
This is achingly sweet and I think Bev made it in a 13x9 sheet pan. She may have made more glaze, she soaked it in the lemon sugar mix and because it was in a sheet pan the middle was soaking! I would halve the sugar, but if itâ€™s what you want go for it!
