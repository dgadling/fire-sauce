## Assembly
- 3 bananas
- 2 tbsp orange juice

## Topping
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 2 tbsp confectioners'/powdered sugar

# Directions
## Half-and-half mixture
1. Melt 1 tbsp butter in medium sauce pan over medium-high heat.
2. Peel 2 bananas and slice into 1/2-inch thick pieces, add and cook until they begin to soften, about 2 minutes.
3. Add half-and-half, bring to boil and boil for 30 seconds. Remove from heat and cover
4. Let sit for 40 minutes

## Pastry cream
1. Whisk granulated sugar, egg yolks, and salt together in a large bowl until smooth. Whisk in corn starch.
2. Strain cooled half-and-half mixture through fine-mesh strainer into yolk mixture **DO NOT PRESS ON BANANAS**. Discard cooked bananas
3. Whisk mixture until incorporated.
4. Transfer to clean medium sauce pan. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until thickened and 180-185 F (about 4-6 minutes).
5. Remove from heat, whisk in remaining 3 tbsp butter and 1 tsp vanilla
6. Transfer this pastry cream to bowl, press greased parchment paper directly against surface and let cool for about 1 hour.

## Pie crust
1. Roll pie dough into 12-inch round on lightly floured counter.
2. Transfer to 9-inch pie plate, fold edge of dough under itself sedge of fold is flush with outer rim of plate, and flute edges.
3. Refrigerate for 40 minutes
4. Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 F.
5. Freeze pie crust for 20 minutes while oven pre-heats
6. Line chilled pie shell with 12-inch square of aluminum foil, folding over edges of dough.
7. Fill with pie weights and bake for 20 minutes.
8. Remove foil & weights, rotate plate, continue baking until crust is golden brown, 7 to 11 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.

## Assemble
1. Whisk pastry cream briefly then spread half over bottom of pie shell.
2. Peel and slice remaining 3 bananas into 1/4 inch thick pieces and toss with orange juice.
3. Arrange sliced bananas on pastry cream, then top with remaining pastry cream.
4. Using a stand mixer with a whisk, whip the cream, confectioners' sugar, and remaining 1/2 tsp vanilla on medium-low speed until foamy, about 1 minute.
5. Increase speed to high and whip until stiff peaks form, 1 to 3 minutes.
6. **Pipe** whipped cream evenly over top of pie, smooth if desired.
    - At this point the pastry cream is probably softer than the whipped cream. This will make spreading challenging, if not impossible. Get it close to how you want it to begin with.

Refigerate until set, at least 5 hours and up to 24 hours, then serve!
