Jess' additions
===============
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 1 teaspoon Pepper Plant California seasoning
- Use smoked paprika if you weren't going to

Tools
=====
- A dutch oven would be best, but a slow cooker works
  - The goal is to make everything in one pot so you get the browned beef bits

Directions
==========
1. Brown the beef in hot oil - if excessive liquid collects in the bottom of the pan, try to keep the liquid away from the browning beef while it reduces.
2. Add Jalapenos, onion, garlic, and green pepper
3. Add tomatillos
4. Add tomato sauce, beef broth, cilantro, paprika, cumin, and seasonings
5. Bring to a boil then reduce heat to simmer
6. Simmer for about 2 hours or until beef is **very** tender
