# Roasties

Creamy on the inside with a thick crispy-crunchy crust on the outside, these are the potatoes that are commonly served for a traditional Sunday lunch alongside prime rib and Yorkshire puddings

## Tips

* You want the oil to be really hot.
* Beat those potatoes up after they're boiled.
* You can vary the potato chunk size. I've found that smaller ones are easier to cook through without burning.
* You'll need to vary the amount of oil depending on the size of your container. You want there to be enough to.
* You can only cook as may potatoes as you can fit flat in your pan.
* I use a dutch oven for this so that it's near impossible to spill hot oil. A shallow roasting pan full of hot oil is not a problem that I want in my life.
* You need a starchy potato.

## Ingredients

* Russet Potatoes
* Kosher salt
* Duck Fat or Olive Oil

## Preparation

1. Preheat the oven to 400F. 
2. Peel the potatoes and cut them into quarters so they are all about the same size; they should be roughly 2–3 inch chunks. Place the potatoes in a large saucepan and add enough cold water to cover them. Season with plenty of salt and bring to a boil over high heat. Once they boil, stir, reduce the heat to medium, and simmer for 5 minutes.
3. While the potatoes cook, add the fat to the roasting pan and place the roasting pan in the oven to heat.
4. Using the lid, carefully drain the water from the pan. Cover the pan and give it a good shake to bash up the potatoes slightly. This creates a rough surface all over the potatoes which helps them crisp in the hot fat. Remove the lid and set the pan aside, uncovered, for the potatoes to dry for a few minutes.
5. Carefully add the potatoes to the hot fat in a single layer so they are not touching and return the pan to the oven. Roast, turning them about every 15 minutes or so, until they are deeply golden brown and crisp and tender throughout, 60–75 minutes.
