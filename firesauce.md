# Ingredients
- 230 g Fresno chiles (“red Jalapeño”) with stems trimmed but green tops left on
- 150 g bell peppers (red/yellow) with stems trimmed flush to top of pepper
- 35 g (one small head, ~ 10 cloves) garlic
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup distilled white vinegar (you’ll need it much later)

This made ~ 5 ounces when pushed through a fine mesh strainer.

# Preparation
1. Medium/rough cut chiles and peppers into ¼" or ½" pieces
2. Peel garlic cloves and cut in half
3. Add everything to blender and blend until “smoothie” consistency
4. Transfer to a glass jar
5. Cover with tea towel/paper towel and secure with a rubber band or similar
6. Put somewhere you don’t mind smelling like hot sauce (a garage is ideal)

# Fermentation
1. Check back in 3 days for tiny fermentation bubbles
2. Stir approximately daily
3. Repeat for at least two more days (five days of fermentation)
   - Or until you stop getting new bubbles
   - **Or** you get bored and decide you want hot sauce

# Finishing
1. Pour fermented stuff back into blender and add ½ cup distilled white vinegar
2. Blend until completely smooth (1-3 minutes)
3. Pour into a fine mesh strainer over a medium sauce pan
4. Push mixture through strainer with a rubber spatula
5. When you think you've got it all pushed through:
   1. Grab anything flat and rigid (table knife, whatever)
   2. Run it along the bottom of the strainer to catch sauce that's stuck there
   3. Repeat this push-and-scrape process until you run out of patience (at least twice more)
6. Bring sauce to a boil and then simmer for 5-10 minutes or until it has the consistency you want.
   - **NOTE**: this sauce will thicken up even more once it cools
7. Let sauce cool for a while, maybe put the pot in the fridge if you have room
8. Bottle as appropriate and stick in the refrigerator, you’re done!

# Variations
All of these variants went through _roughly_ the above process, for varying amounts of time (due to laziness/schedules). **NOTE** that basically all of these came out to ~ 4 cups (2 pints/1 quart) of mash to ferment. Plan jars appropriately.

# Variation Results
## Smoked Anaheim :frowning:
- Fermentation time: Unrecorded
- Finishing steps: as in the recipe above
- Yield: 2 cups
- **NOTES**: Came out **super** bitter for some reason and **super** smoky. Nothing in finishing could save it so it got left in the fridge unfinished in hopes it would mellow. The current theory is that the amount of solids that ended up in the sauce is what doomed it.

## Green 9.2 :relaxed:
- Fermentation time: ~ 10 days
- Finishing steps: Added ½C vinegar, very mild reduction, ½tsp [Xanthan Gum](https://www.bobsredmill.com/xanthan-gum.html) via WholeFoods
- Yield: 2 cups
- **NOTES**: Came out **great** but started separating after finishing. Didn't cook it down much because it had pretty good texture after straining. Added solids to thicken it but that started making it bitter so took the solids back out. Learned about Xanthan Gum from [this article](https://www.pepperscale.com/sauce-too-thin-how-to-thicken-hot-sauce/) -- may have used too much.

## Orange 9.2 :relaxed:
- Fermentation time: ~ 9 days
- Finish steps: Added ⅛C apple cider vinegar, very mild reduction on the stove, ½tsp xanthan gum
- Yield: 2 cups
- **NOTES**: Came out **great**, shorter heat-reaction than the greena bove

## White 9.10 :frowning:
- Lost due to mold during fermentation + not smelling like anything after the mold was removed

## Red 9.9 :relaxed:
- Fermentation time: 12 days
- Finishing steps: Added ⅛C apple cider vinegar, ½tsp xanthan gum
- Yield: ~ 1.75 cups
- **NOTES**: **NICE** and red, nice and spicy. Generally pretty good.

## Orange 9.15 :neutral_face:
- Fermentation time: 7 days
- Finishing steps: Added ⅛C apple cider vinegar, ¼ + ⅛tsp xanthan gum
- Yield: 2 cups
- **NOTES**: Decent, not especially spicy by Dave's standards

## Orange Dragon 9.15 :confused:
- Fermentation time: 7 days
- Finishing steps: Added ⅛C seasoned rice wine vinegar plus a bit more, ¼tsp xanthan gum
- Yield: 2 cups + a little extra
- **NOTES**: Slightly spicier than normal orange. Has some kind of funk in the beginning that's novel. Came out OK
